README for simplesql

This is a Bash script.
The purpose, like most programs, is to support my lazyness.

By creating the $usage portion, it reminded me what parameters
I needed to get a particular job done. 

Also, I have used a variety of mysql commands to accomplish things.

And as time went on, I found a need to do some special things for
our Drupal databases. So, there are some Drupal specific features
that I have put here as well.

The easiest way to learn the use of the script is to just launch 
it with -h for help. This will print out the usage portion of 
the script.

LOCATION

I normally would put this in my ~/bin directory and set it to be executable.

SUPPORTING FILE

This script is as I said, for my lazyness. If you supply a file named
simplesql.conf, you can place default values there.

I use it to support about 30 different mysql servers. Each with hundreds of
databases. Many of them are Drupal databases, so that explains the extra
features that are Drupal specific.

The struction fo the 'simplesql.conf' file is documented at the front
of the simplesql script.
